# Secret-Decoder-Ring
Write a program that allows the user to encrypt or decrypt messages using different types
of encryption methods. Ask the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a message,
if they choose encrypt, prompt them to type in a message and to choose an encryption
type, Atbash, or Caesar, if they choose Caesar, prompt them for a shift amount (1-25).
Encrypt the message and write it to a file called ‘message.txt’ (leave any spaces or
punctuation the same). If they choose to decrypt, prompt them to choose a decryption
type, and a shift amount if they choose Caesar. Decrypt the message read in from the
‘message.txt’ file and display it to the screen.
